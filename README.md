## To run demo

```
  $ cd demo
  $ yarn
  $ yarn start
```

Skip `yarn` if dependencies already installed.

`cd demo/finalComponents` contains the final components with tests.

## To run slides

with server:
```
  $ cd slides
  $ yarn
  $ yarn start

This also works with just opening the path to `index.html` in the browser. Skip `yarn` if dependencies already installed.
