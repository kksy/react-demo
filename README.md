Skip `yarn` if dependencies already installed.

`TodoApp.js` is the file that you need to change to display your changes. The files `TodoApp.*.js` contains the step-by-step process of building the final app.

`cd demo/finalComponents` contains the final components with tests.

with server:
```
  $ cd slides
